**Presentation Outline (Slide by Slide):**

1.  **Title Slide:**
    -   Headline: SecureTrack
    -   Sub-headline: The Ultimate Anti-Theft & Recovery Suite.
    -   Visual: A glowing holographic shield protecting a smartphone.

2.  **The Problem:**
    -   Point 1: Smartphone theft is rising globally.
    -   Point 2: The first thing a thief does is **Power Off** the device to disable "Find My Device".
    -   Point 3: Once offline, the phone is untraceable.

3.  **The Solution:**
    -   Headline: What if your phone *couldn't* stick to the thief's plan?
    -   Concept: SecureTrack ensures your device stays ON and connected, even when it looks off.

4.  **The "Secret Sauce" (Killer Feature): Fake Shutdown:**
    -   Description: When an intruder tries to power off, SecureTrack interrupts the system and displays a **fake shutdown animation**.
    -   Result: The screen goes black, vibration occurs, audio stops. The thief thinks it's off.
    -   Reality: The phone is effectively ON, tracking location, taking photos, and listening.

5.  **Command Center (SMS Protocol):**
    -   Headline: Control Without Internet.
    -   Description: Use any other phone to send stealth SMS commands:
        -   `#LOCATE_<PIN>`: Returns exact GPS coordinates.
        -   `#SIREN_<PIN>`: Triggers max-volume alarm (bypasses silent mode).
        -   `#LOCK_<PIN>`: Instantly locks the device.

6.  **Additional Security Layer:**
    -   **Intruder Selfie:** Takes a photo when the wrong PIN is entered.
    -   **SIM Change Alert:** Sends new number if the thief swaps the SIM.
    -   **Passive Mode:** Runs silently without draining battery.

7.  **Why We Win:**
    -   Unlike standard trackers, we handle the "Power Off" scenario.
    -   We work via SMS (GSM), so no data plan is needed for emergencies.
    -   Stealth focus: The thief doesn't know they are being tracked.

8.  **Call to Action:**
    -   Headline: Secure Your World.
    -   Text: Available now for Android.
    -   Footer: Developed by Iamjunade.

**Tone of Voice:**
Confident, Innovative, Secure, Professional.
